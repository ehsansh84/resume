### Projects
>#### Senior Backend Developer – `K8S Cluster manager` 2021
> `Description:` I created a microservice to provide kubernetes as a service, User can request for a cluster with 
> specific workers with specified configurations, Then microservice requests for resources from openstack cloud,
> configures servers and creates a kubernetes cluster for the customer.    
> `Challenges:` There were challenges to deal with cloud platform and 3rd party errors and also interfering tasks for multi cluster
> requests. I solved them by breaking down whole process to multiple tiny tasks in sequences.

>#### Senior Backend Developer – DevOps Engineer `Miz business directory – onmiz.com` 2017 – 2021
> `Description:` I designed and developed backend for this business directory to provide users information extracted 
> from lots of geographic data gathered from users or crawled from sources   
> `Challenges:` To keep data valid after a while, I designed a gamification system for users, to collect points in 
> exchange of validating our data. Another challenge was lots of different queries and providing fast response to user 
> that I handled that using MongoDB indices and redis cache and sometimes elasticsearch for text based queries.    

> #### Senior Backend Developer `Miz News Hub – mizkhabar.com` 2019
> `Description:` In this project I created parallel crawlers to crawl news from more than 200 sources every minute. 
> Crawling from HTML pages, not only RSS feeds.   
> `Challenges:` There was lots of challenges in this project:
> - To handle different HTML structures for each website, I stored structure info inside database for each source and 
use that info in crawlers. 
> - To handle rate limits I decided to request in parallel from multiple IPs and of course with more delay.
> - To handle faster queries, I stored last 24 news inside Redis, about 99% of user requests was for these news and 
querying from Redis was very good idea.    

>#### Senior Backend Developer `Zibasoo online beauty salon booking system` Jan 2018 – Aug 2020
> `Description:` An online beauty salon reservation system that you can find and compare salon's portfolios and prices
> and decide to choose the most suitable services for you.  
> `Challenges:` Designing a suitable workflow for user to be able to book a time while there are lots of variety in 
> salon's times and employees schedules.

>#### Senior Backend developer `Currency signals` 2018
> `Description:` Currency signals is a project to release buy/sell signals for Binance platform. There are daemons that
> analyze 1600 Crypto currencies based on some strategies using different indicators to find buy/sell signals. 
> The results could be seen on a web panel and be filtered as you wish.  
> `Challenges:` To deal with Binance rate limits I created parallel API requests from multiple servers. 

>#### Senior Backend developer `Negahe khabari news bulletin maker` May 2013 – Aug 2016
> `Description:` Negahe khabari is a News Hub project which crawls news from different sources and let user have a 
> customized bulletin  based on his/her interests  
> `Challenges:` To show user important news first, I invented a very tricky algorythm to find importance of a news by total
> shares and like in social networks like twitter and also considering period of growth and lots of other factors.

>#### Web developer `Lots of web sites for people and companies` Apr 2010 – Sep 2012
