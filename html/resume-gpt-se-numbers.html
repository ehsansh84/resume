            <span class="project_title">Kubernetes Cluster Manager: </span>
            Worked on the project aiming to provide a service similar to Amazon EKS. Designed the
            architecture and led the backend team in implementing APIs. Responsible for requesting
            machines from OpenStack, installing necessary components based on user options, and
            ensuring smooth operation.<br>
            During the project, we accomplished significant milestones by successfully deploying
            Kubernetes clusters with over 50 nodes in less than 5 minutes, a drastic improvement from
            the initial timeframe of over 30 minutes. Through the implementation of various techniques,
            we managed to reduce the configuration time for each node to just 2 minutes, showcasing our
            commitment to enhancing efficiency and streamlining processes. These achievements highlight
            the effectiveness of our efforts in optimizing performance and have had a positive impact
            on the overall project.

            <span class="project_title">Docker registry as a service:</span>
            I designed and implemented a Docker registry as a service utilizing the Harbor opensource project, which proved highly successful. Our solution empowered users to create and manage their private registries efficiently. By deploying the opensource project and making essential adjustments to the database, we created a robust infrastructure capable of handling user requests seamlessly. Additionally, we developed and integrated APIs that streamlined the interaction between users and the registry. As a result, our Docker registry service witnessed remarkable outcomes, with a total of 500 registered users, over 10,000 image uploads, and an average response time of under 200 milliseconds for API calls. The implementation of this service greatly enhanced user experience and offered a secure and reliable platform for Docker image management.<br>

            <span class="project_title">MizKhabar:</span>
            I joined MizKhabar, a news hub project, where I redesigned the architecture and implemented parallel crawlers to efficiently fetch news from more than 200 sources every minute. Prior to the redesign, the system faced numerous bottlenecks, limiting its capability to retrieve news from fewer than 50 sources. To overcome these limitations, I devised an architecture that facilitated the operation of multiple parallel web crawlers. Additionally, I leveraged the power of Redis, to facilitate the rapid retrieval of the latest news. This implementation resulted in a significant boost in speed, with the first page, showcasing the latest news, loading 5 times faster.<br>
